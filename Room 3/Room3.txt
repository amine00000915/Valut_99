Challenge 3: The Gate of Shadows
Storyline:
You decode the Guardianâ€™s message and step into a dimly lit hallway, the air thick with the weight of time.
Ancient shields and rusted weapons line the walls.
At the far end, a weathered gate stands, engraved with the word "Shadows." On the wall beside it, an inscription reads:  
"I am what protects, yet I am not seen. I shield the warrior and never flee. Without me, you shall fall. What am I?"
Task:  
To unlock the gate, extract characters from the lines in a "stairs" pattern:
- Line 1: Take the first character.  
- Line 2: Take the last character.  
- Line 3: Take the first character.  
- Line 4: Take the last character.  
- Line 5: Take the first character.
