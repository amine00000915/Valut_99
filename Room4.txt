Challenge 4: The Inscription of the Hidden Guard
You enter Room 4 and see an ancient table filled with letters and numbers, with a mysterious inscription carved into the wall. 
It reads:
"Guarded in plain sight, letters hide within rows both humble and proud. Numbers deceive; only pure lines can reveal the answer.
Look closely: where lower yields upper, and upper yields lower, the hidden name awaits."

Task:
Analyze each line in the table:

Skip any line containing numbers.
If a line has only lowercase letters, keep any uppercase letters in that line.
If a line has only uppercase letters, keep any lowercase letters in that line.
Combine the Letters: Join all the collected characters together, convert them to uppercase, and reveal the final codeword.
