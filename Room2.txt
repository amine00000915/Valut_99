Challenge 2: The Guardian’s Enigma
Storyline:  
Having unlocked the first gate with the Lost Weapon, you step into a dimly lit chamber, the walls covered in ancient, cryptic carvings.
In the center, a stone pedestal holds an ominous scroll, its surface cracked with age. On the pedestal, an inscription reads:  
"I protect the wearer, I shield the mind, but without me, you are vulnerable to all. What am I?"  
The room trembles with a foreboding energy, ready to ensnare those who fail. The scroll holds the key to escape.
Solve the riddle and the path will be revealed.
Task:  
To reveal the codeword and escape, extract one character from each line of the scroll (Challenge2.txt) following this pattern:
- Line 1: Take the first character.  
- Line 2: Take the second character.  
- Line 3: Take the third character.  
- Line 4: Take the fourth character.  
- Line 5: Take the fifth character.  
- Line 6: Take the sixth character.  
Combine these characters in order to unlock the Guardian’s Enigma and proceed deeper into Vault_99.
