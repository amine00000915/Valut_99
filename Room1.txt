Challenge 1: The Lost Weapon
Storyline: 
You have arrived at the first gate, but it’s locked and hidden somewhere nearby. 
Legends say the gate can only be opened by a key forged from the letters scattered across ancient writings. 
If you gather the letters correctly, you’ll reveal the word that will unlock the gate.
Task: 
Write a program to extract the first character from each line of a given text file.
Then merge these characters in the order they appear to unlock the key.
