Challenge 5: The Final Trial – The Guardian's Riddle

Storyline:
You’ve journeyed far through Vault_99, and now you stand before the final door, guarded by a powerful presence.
A voice echoes, challenging you:
"I am the keeper of the final secrets. Solve my riddle to pass, or remain forever blocked from the treasure within."

The voice whispers:

"I begin where the night ends,  
And end where the dawn begins,  
I protect the strong and defend the weak,  
I am the shadow that never fades.  
Who am I?"

Task:
To unlock the final door, extract the last character from each line of the riddle.
Combine these letters to uppercase in order to reveal the name of the guardian.
Only then will the path to the treasure be open.
Hint:
Remove the line with the repeated word.
